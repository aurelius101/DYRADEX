                <p>It uses its rock-hard head to crush nuts and seeds.</p>
                <p>Insatiably curious, Cheepit will investigate anything that catches its fancy, <br>often destroying it in the process. </p>
                <p>Its head is heavier than its body, so when it gets too excited, it’s prone to tipping over.</p>

                <p>These Pokemon have a rebellious streak and will challenge their own trainer to a battle if riled up.</p> 
                <p>In the wild, flock hierarchy is determined by whichever individual has the most impressive crest.</p>

                <div class="name">Kotylodon</div>
                <p>It uses its bright warning plumage in threat display.  It frequently picks fights.</p> 
                <p>It is fiercely territorial and will rip up plants and trees that it perceives to be invading its habitat. 
                <br>Seeds that fall from its feathers are harder than any known stone.</p>

                <p>These Pokémon used to be often seen floating in water in large groups.
                Large group sightings of these Pokémon may often signify an incoming storm.</p>

                <p>These Pokemon are seen much more solitary than Inkle and separate from their groups.</p> 
                <p>They walk on their powerful tentacles to seem bigger and more intimidating.</p>

                <div class="name">Medumbra</div>
                <p>Medumbra are known as aggressive, volatile Pokemon, with their aggression deemed territorial. 
                They are solitary, much like Jellinks, and pack a powerful punch.</p>
                <p>These Pokemon can "float" for small periods of time.</p>

                <p>It disperses heat through its large ears. <br>The intensity and heat of the flames indicate Mongrowl’s emotions.</p>
                <p>Its flames never goes out, just like its loyalty.</p>

                <div class="name">Scorchound</div>
                <p>As Scorchound matures, it displays erratic and aggressive behaviour. Its own tail begins vaguely resembling a serpent as it gains its own separate conscience.</p>
                <p>Scorchound will often seek solitude, afraid of accidentally harming its Trainer.</p>

                <div class="name">Howlfire</div>
                <p>Despite the intense and dangerous appearance of its flames, Howlfire has it under control.</p>
                <p>The more close it is with its Trainer, the hotter its flames burn.</p>
